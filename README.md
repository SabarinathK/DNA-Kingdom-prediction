### DNA Kingdom prediction using Codon for diverse organisms.
- Examined codon usage frequencies in the genomic coding DNA of a large sample of diverse organisms from 
different taxa tabulated in the CUTG database with 13028 rows and 69 columns as features.
- Codon frequencies ('codon') including 'UUU', 'UUA', 'UUG', 'CUU', etc., are recorded as floats (with decimals 
in 5 digits).
- Decision tree and ensemble algorithms was trained, model selection is done and a web app is created.
